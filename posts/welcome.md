# Welcome to the Lab

This starter is intentionally small. Everything is plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript to render the post list. There is no build step, so GitHub Pages can serve it directly.

## How to add a new post
1. Duplicate this file under `posts/` and change the content.
2. Update `data/posts.js` with the title, date, tags, markdown path, and slug.
3. Commit and push to `main`. GitHub Pages will update automatically.

## Content tips
- Keep titles short and specific.
- Use the tags field to group related work.
- Include a brief excerpt in `data/posts.js` so the homepage stays scannable.

## Why static
Static pages are easy to version, cheap to host, and fast for readers. If you later need a build step (Markdown, React, etc.), you can add it gradually.
